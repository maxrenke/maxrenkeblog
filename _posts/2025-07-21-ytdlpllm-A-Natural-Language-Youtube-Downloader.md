## Introduction

I'm excited to introduce **ytdlpllm**, a tool I created to make downloading YouTube videos as easy as chatting with an AI. With ytdlpllm, you can use natural language commands to fetch videos, playlists, or even just audioâ€”no complicated command-line flags required.

## What is ytdlpllm?

ytdlpllm is a self-hosted web app that leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret your requests. Instead of memorizing options or URLs, you simply tell the app what you want, like:

> "Download the latest video from Veritasium in 1080p."

The app figures out the rest, using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) under the hood for the actual downloading.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Interface:** Just type what you want to download.
- **Self-Hosted:** Run it on your own machine or server for privacy and control.
- **Flexible Output:** Download videos, playlists, or extract audio.
- **LLM-Powered:** Uses an LLM to parse your intent and generate the correct yt-dlp command.
- **Web UI:** Simple, clean interface accessible from your browser.

## How It Works

1. **Enter your request** in plain English.
2. The app uses an LLM to convert your request into a yt-dlp command.
3. yt-dlp downloads the content.
4. You get a download link right in your browser.

## Getting Started

To try it out, clone the repo and follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/maxrenke/ytdlpllm):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxrenke/ytdlpllm.git
cd ytdlpllm
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then, open your browser to `http://localhost:7860` and start downloading with natural language!

## Why I Built This

I wanted a YouTube downloader that anyone could use without learning command-line options or scripts. By combining the power of LLMs with yt-dlp, ytdlpllm makes video downloading accessible and intuitive.

## Try It Out
